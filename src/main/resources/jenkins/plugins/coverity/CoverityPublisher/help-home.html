        The default path to the Coverity Static Analysis install (it has
        subdirectories "bin", "config", etc.). This is used when running
        Coverity Static Analysis on the master node. For other slaves, the
        location can be overridden on the slave configuration page. If no
        location is set, you should make sure the Coverity Static Analysis
        tools can be found on the PATH.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Coverity Static Analysis tools must already be configured
        with the necessary compilers using cov-configure, and the license
        file must already be in the "bin" directory.
