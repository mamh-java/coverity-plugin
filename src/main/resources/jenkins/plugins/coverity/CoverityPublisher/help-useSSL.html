    Should an SSL (https) connection be used? If checked, it is important to make sure the SSL certificate used
    by Coverity Connect is trusted by the Jenkins VM, e.g. by providing the following system
    properties when starting Jenkins: "-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=XXX
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=YYY"
