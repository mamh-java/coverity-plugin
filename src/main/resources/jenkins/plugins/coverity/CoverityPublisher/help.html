    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5em">How to configure the Coverity Jenkins plugin</span>

    <p>
        The Coverity Jenkins plugin is designed to efficiently handle several different use cases. Some cases, however,
        are restricted by the environment. This help section details how to properly configure the Coverity Jenkins
        plugin for your environment. You can use the "Check Configuration" button to check for errors in your stream
        configuration. In addition, another check will run before each build. This second check will also verify that
        the analysis environment is compatible with your configuration.
    </p>

    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em">Environments</span>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.0em">Coverity Analysis 7.0 or later</span>

            <p>
                This environment allows you to specify one or all languages for each stream. Since analysis results are
                combined in version 7.0, each stream must be able to receive results for each analyzed language.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To analyze all languages, make sure your streams are set to the 'Any' language type in Coverity
                    Connect. Then select the 'All' language setting in the Coverity Jenkins plugin in every stream you
                    would like to commit results to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To analyze a single language, make sure all streams are configured to receive that defects from the
                    language in Coverity Connect. Then select only that language, in the Coverity Jenkins plugin, for
                    each stream to commit defects to.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.0em">Coverity Analysis before 7.0</span>

            <p>
                This environment allows you to specify one language for each stream. For each language, the appropriate
                analysis will be run. Then, for each stream, the corresponding language analysis results will be
                committed.
                Any combination of languages can be used, but each must be a single-language stream as configured in
                Coverity Connect.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
