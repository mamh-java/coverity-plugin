        Additional arguments for cov-build. Use single or double quotes if necessary as you would on the command line.
        --dir is automatically provided by Jenkins and should not be overridden.
    </p>

    <p>
        These additional arguments will be placed before the normal build command on the cov-build command line. The
        normal build command is a shell script that Jenkins creates automatically, and it contains all of the steps
        listed in the Build section, above.
