    <p>
  Defects found by the Coverity analysis are first filtered according to
  the settings here.  If a defect matches all the filters, then it will
  be included in the list of "Coverity Defects" associated with the build,
  and in the defect count trend chart.  Furthermore, if any defect matches
  the filters, and the "Fail the build if matching defects are found" box
  is checked, then the build will be marked as a failure.
    <p>
 Defects are filtered according to action, severity, component,
  checker, classification, impact and date found.  The classification filter is
  deliberately not configurable.  If a date (yyyy-mm-dd) is specified,
  then only defects found on or after that date pass the filter.  This is
  useful to establish a "base line" of existing defects that will be
  tolerated, whereas new defects will not be.
